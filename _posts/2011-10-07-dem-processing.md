# Japan's Digital Elevation Model
The [Geospatial Information Authority of Japan](https://fgd.gsi.go.jp/download/menu.php) hosts one of my all time favorite datasets: digital elevation model (DEM) of Japan. This is such a cool dataset and there is a really nice visualization technique I've found that allows seamless visualization over the entire country of Japan.
