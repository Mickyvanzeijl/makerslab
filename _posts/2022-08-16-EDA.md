# EDA in Data Science

## Exploratory Data Analysis Relevance

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data science process that allows us to understand the structure and relationships within a dataset. It involves visualizing, summarizing, and transforming the data to uncover patterns and insights that inform the development of predictive models. Here are a few reasons why EDA is so important in data science:

1. Identifying patterns and relationships: EDA helps us understand how different variables within a dataset relate to each other. This is crucial for identifying potential predictor variables and building accurate predictive models.

2. Detecting outliers and anomalies: EDA can help us identify any unusual or unexpected data points, which can be critical for avoiding misleading results and improving the accuracy of our models.

3. Understanding the distribution of the data: By visualizing the distribution of the data, we can gain a better understanding of the central tendency and spread of the data, which can inform the choice of statistical methods and models.

4. Improving the quality of the data: EDA can help us identify issues with the data such as missing values, duplicates, or inconsistent formats. By fixing these issues, we can improve the quality of the data and increase the accuracy of our results.

5. Providing insights for data cleaning and pre-processing: EDA helps us identify issues with the data that require cleaning and pre-processing, such as transforming variables to a more suitable form, or removing outliers or irrelevant data points.

In conclusion, EDA is an essential step in the data science process that provides valuable insights and improves the quality of the data. It helps us understand the structure of the data, identify potential predictor variables, and avoid misleading results. By taking the time to perform EDA, we can ensure that our data is well understood, and that our models are based on accurate and relevant data.

## Utilizing EDA to De-tangle Seattle, US Real Estate Market

At the Neuefische bootcamp, the EDA work was performed to the House sales in the King County dataset. The dataset is publicly available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). To simulate a world case scenario. Different stakeholders with individual requirements were previous established by the Neuefische team. In this analysis I simulated a realtor company who conducted the EDA to fulfill the needs of a fictional investor named Timothy Stevens. Mr Stevens sells houses and is interested in putting his investments in the market. He owns expensive houses in the county center, which needs to get rid off. The best timing  is within a year, he is open for renovation when profits rise.
