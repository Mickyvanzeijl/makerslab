A few projects from the minor of 2021. This year, we partnered up with the Biodesign Challenge, an international competition and education program to support and shape the first generation of biodesigners. Our students explored the do’s, don’ts and dilemmas of designing with living organisms. 

## Inkfinity: Rethink Colour

​Inkfinity is a proposal for a brand that makes bacteria-based pigments, that can be  renewable, vegan and are produced without the use of harmful chemicals. Bacteria pigment can be produced locally and has potential to scale. Could bacteria help alleviate pressures on the supply chain of raw materials traditionally used for ink production, and reduce its impact on the environment? Together with artists, we rethink the future of colour.​
