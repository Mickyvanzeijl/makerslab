introduction: |
  Welcome to my personal blog page. Here you will find an assortment of posts exploring a number of unique geospatial datasets as well as methods to process spatial data. I cover a range of topics including spatial statistics and deep dives into recent deep learning models that can be used to extract geospatial insights. All the code for each post is available from my [GitHub account](https://github.com/danielhoshizaki). For a look at my professional experince, please refer to my [portfolio](https://danielhoshizaki.com/portfolio/) and resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-hoshizaki-25b3a659/)
