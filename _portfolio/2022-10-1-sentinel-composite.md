I created a process that outputs clear-sky satellite images of ANY location on the globe. The process is fully automated and can return a clear tile given a Setninel-2 cell. It even works for locations that are typically hard to process, like the tropics where there is almost year-round cloud cover. Read on to see examples and find out how I put this project together.
