Are you curious, creative, and critical?
Join us for a semester (30 ects)of transdisciplinary making, experiments, hacking, tinkering, digital fabrication, soft robotics, and electronics. This semester course offered at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences provides intense training in digital fabrication (tools and techniques like laser cutting, 3D printing, new materials, and electronics) and an introduction to tinkering and making-as-research.

In a world where disposable products dominate, itâ€™s time to rethink the value of making and the way we make things. We have a DIY and open-source approach. This international minor challenges you to think critically about the impact of your creations on the environment. We explore alternative and more sustainable ways of making things. We aim to empower you to become a critical maker and tinkerer. In this minor, the act of making and tinkering is a way to research, discover, and push boundaries. 

This semester, the Makers Lab at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences is your playground.
