#### In my past life I was an artist: now I'm in the <span style="color:#CC5500">shell</span> of a programmer. <br>I'm interested in art, geospatial data, and deep-learning.
 
I write about geospatial deep learning and data science in my [blog](https://danielhoshizaki.com/blog/). All my other spare time goes to making interesting visualizations and art. You can see examples of my projects in my [portfolio](https://danielhoshizaki.com/).
 
If I don't have to stare at a computer, I prefer to be outside spending time with my daughter, skiing, mountain biking, or surfing.
