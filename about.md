### Hi, I'm Daniel.
#### I'm passionate about wrangling insights out of geospatial datasets.
 
I currently work as the lead data scientist for a satellite manufacturer startup, [Axelspace](https://www.axelspace.com/).
Prior to that, I worked as a GIS application programmer for a renewable energy startup, [GPSS](https://gpssgroup.jp/). You can check out my portfolio here and my resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-hoshizaki-25b3a659/).
 
In my spare time I enjoy finding and tinkering with new spatial datasets for Japan. I blog about how I process these datasets as well as how to use deep learning to extract insights from the data.
 
I also enjoy skiing, mountain biking, and photography.
