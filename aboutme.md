Hi! I'm Mithil Vakde.  
I'm an undergrad pursuing a B.Tech in Chemical Engineering at IIT Bombay. (Might change to Engineering Physics in the near future) Currently, I work in the Machine Learning Subdivision at Innovation Cell, IIT Bombay. You can find me either toling away at the UMIC lab or at the Volleyball court.

### Hobbies  
I'm a dancer, a drummer and I play volleball as an outside hitter (hoping to make it to the college team).   
I love Physics, Mathematics and the general pursuit of knowledge.
Devouring novels is one of my pasttime (except Dostoevsky. Way too long) along with making puns and finding anagrams.

### Currently Working on  
Making an OCR on images captured by a drone in natural backgrounds.  
Making this Website.  
A few other things that are kept secret _for now_.
